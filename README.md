# Password Generator

## Purpose
    To randomly generate a password using the criteria the user submits. The password can include either all or one of the follow: uppercase letter, lowercase letters, special characters (!@#$%&*), and/or numbers. 

## How to Use
To begin, click on the Generate Password buttons. You will then get a series of prompts with questions related to what you would like the password to include and how long you would like it to be (the length must be between 8 and 128 characters). Once all prompts have been answered, the generated password will appear in the ReadOnly box. You can then either highlight the text and copy it yourself or you can click on the Copy to Clipboard button.
